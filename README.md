# **Abstract**

Electroencephalography (EEG) is used to diagnose, monitor, and prognosis various neurological diseases.  One of the most difficult aspects of EEG data is its susceptibility to a wide range of non-stationary noises caused by physiological, movement, and equipment artefacts. Existing artefact detection methods are inadequate because they need specialists to manually examine and annotate data for artefact parts. Existing artefact correction or removal methods are ineffective.  In this paper, proposed is a EEG noise-reduction technique that uses an unsupervised learning algorithm to identify eye blinks and jaw clench artefacts. The approach extracts important features and uses an unsupervised detection algorithm to identify EEG artefacts that are particular to a given task and individual. By making the approach, code, and data public, offered is a tool that is both immediately useful and may serve as an essential basis for future research in this area.

# **1.0 ~ Introduction**

Electroencephalography (EEG) equipment are widely utilised in clinical research, teaching, entertainment, and a wide range of other applications. However, most EEG applications are still restricted by the poor signal-to-noise ratio inherent in EEG data. Movement artefacts, physiological artefacts (e.g., sweat), and instrument artefacts are all causes of EEG noise (resulting from the EEG device itself). While researchers have developed a variety of techniques for identifying particular instances of these artefacts in EEG data, the majority of these methods involve manual tagging of example artefact segments or additional hardware, such as Electrooculography electrodes implanted around the eyes.

Manual annotation of artefacts in EEG data is difficult because it takes time and may be impossible if the particular profiles of artefacts in EEG data change as a function of the task, the person, or the experimental trial within a given task for a given subject, as they often do. These facts rapidly escalate the complexity of the artefact annotation issue, rendering a one-size-fits-all artefact identification approach impractical for many practical use cases.

One significant difficulty of artefact identification in EEG processing is that the concept of “artefact” varies depending on the job at hand. That is, an EEG segment is considered an artefact if and only if it degrades the performance of downstream techniques by appearing as uncorrelated noise in a feature space relevant to those methods. Muscle movement signatures, for example, confuse comma-prognostic categorization yet are helpful characteristics for identifying sleep stages.

The task-specific character of artefacts makes them particularly suited for detection utilising data-driven unsupervised techniques, since the only condition for identifying artefacts using such methods is that the artefacts be relatively rare. In other words, when we map our data into feature spaces relevant to the particular EEG task, artefacts should show out as uncommon abnormalities. Indeed, several cutting-edge techniques use unsupervised algorithms for detecting particular artefact types under specified conditions.

EEG artifact removal is one instance of a more general class of noise reduction problems. The removal of noise from signal data has been a topic of scientific inquiry since the 1940s; over the years, multiple signal processing approaches to this problem have found their way into EEG research. One such technique for artifact removal that is ubiquitous for EEG processing is Independent Component Analysis (ICA). This method and its modern derivative remain popular among the research community for unsupervised artifact correction. However, ICA still requires EEG experts to review the decomposed signals and manually classify them as either signal or noise.

Furthermore, while ICA is undeniably an invaluable tool for many EEG applications, it also has limitations that are particularly poignant when the number of channels is low; ICA can only extract as many independent components as there are channels and will therefore be unable to isolate all independent noise components if the total number of independent noise components and signal sources exceeds the number of EEG electrodes.

When conducting the recording sessions required for data collection for BCI devices, there are many difficulties to overcome. There were two headsets involved in this study. The primary headset tested was a modified version of the Ultracortex “Mark IV” headset from OpenBCI. This modification consisted of an added belt on the inside of the base of the headset. This helped to secure the headset to the user's head while reducing the impact of any movement on the electrode locations. The electrodes were the dry, spiky electrodes that came with the headset, and the headset was tightened so that it would not shift readily with minor movement by tightening the belt loop on the inner rim. The neck strap exerted downward stress on the spring-loaded electrodes, resulting in more contact and a reduced impedance of the dry electrodes. Finally, it was discovered that adding a little quantity of electrode gel further reduced the electrode impedance while avoiding many of the typical errors and problems associated with electrodes.

There were six datasets involved in this dataset, three recorded from the primary headset, the modified OpenBCI, and the three other recorded from a Muse. Below is a summary of what each dataset entailed:
